// Agents Deck — Linear extension.
//
// A standalone Gradle build, like `extensions/tessl` and `samples/extension-starter`: a
// first-party extension must compile against the *published host artifact*, not against a
// sibling source project, or the api's only regression gate (`./gradlew verifyExtensions` in
// the host) would be verifying a lie.
//
// The two builds meet in one place: the `agentsDeckPluginZip` property in `gradle.properties`.
//
// Line comments, not a block comment: Kotlin block comments nest, so a path glob written
// inside one opens a second comment the closing marker only half closes.
